            <p style="font-size:14px;">Create users for LEAPS admin, or users that can access the schools / universities pages.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">NOTE that schools / universities users are also created and can be updated from the related schools 
            / universities supporting data.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">Schools / universities users should have a username that matches their email address, and must be associated 
              with a school or university. NOTE THESE USERS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN VIEW_ADMIN, EDIT_STUDENTS, OR DO_ADMIN PRIVILEGES.</p>
            <p>Users where "perform interviews" is selected will be available to LEAPS admin users to select as an interviewer to assign a student 
                survey to. They will also be able to login to the interviewers page, view students assigned to them, and perform related interview actions.
                NOTE a user can "perform interviews" whilst also having other attributes such as being a school contact.
                "Perform and manage interviews" allows a user to assign other users as interviewers.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">For LEAPS admin users, create a user with your preferred username, and select if the user should have DO_ADMIN, 
              EDIT_STUDENTS, or VIEW_ADMIN privileges. Although you can more than one, the permissions cascade down anyway.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">VIEW_ADMIN allows a user to access the LEAPS /admin area and to view any information there, but NOT to edit 
              anything. EDIT_STUDENTS access further allows a user to edit current student records and create new student records, but nothing else. 
              DO_ADMIN allows a user to access the LEAPS /admin area and to edit / delete / add to anything there.</p>
            <p style="font-size:14px;">Some functions, such as creating new users (beyond those that can be created via the schools / universities supporting data), or turning surveys and schools / universities pages on and off, are only available to 
              the super user. Super user privileges cannot be bestowed upon any new users via this interface - super users can only be created via the 
              application settings on the server.</p>
