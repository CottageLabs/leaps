        <h2>About LEAPS</h2>

        <p>LEAPS is a successful and unique widening participation programme, funded by its 
        <a href="http://www.leapsonline.org/node/1089">higher education institution and
        local council partners</a> to increase progression to higher education in South East Scotland. We aim to encourage and
        advise students who are traditionally under-represented in higher education and we currently work with
        <a href="http://www.leapsonline.org/node/1137">state secondary schools</a>
        throughout South East Scotland, supporting pupils who match
        <a href="http://www.leapsonline.org/node/1081">LEAPS eligibility criteria</a>. LEAPS is also
        supported by Skills Development Scotland and delivers the Scottish Funding Council's 
        <a href="http://www.sfc.ac.uk/access-inclusion/access-initiatives/access-initiatives.aspx">Schools for Higher Education
        Programme</a> (SHEP) in South East Scotland. LEAPS is hosted by the University of Edinburgh.</p>
