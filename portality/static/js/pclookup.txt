    <p><b>Other LEAPS Eligibility Criteria (for <a href="/about/our-schools">Group 2 schools</a>)</b></p>

    <p>In <a href="/about/our-schools">Group 2 schools</a>, we support students who have the potential to achieve a minimum of 3 highers by the time they finish school and match one or more of the following LEAPS eligibility criteria:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>student who is first generation in family to apply to higher education or whose parents do not already have a degree. This includes students whose parents may have briefly participated in higher education but did not achieve a degree. (Please note that a student whose parent/guardian/carer has achieved any degree - irrespective of mode of study, type of institution, location of study - would not be LEAPS eligible under this criterion.)</li>
    	<li>student from a low income background (for instance, where a student is entitled to EMA, free meals in school, or where the family is on income support).</li>
    	<li>student who has spent time in care or being looked after</li>
    	<li>student who is a young carer - by this we mean a young person who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are unsure if you or an individual is eligible for LEAPS support, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a> for clarification.</p>
